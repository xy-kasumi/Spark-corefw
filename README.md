# Spark Core

WIP

Zephyr-based firmware for https://github.com/xy-kasumi/Spark.


## Licenses
* Main app code (app/src, tests/app/src): AGPL-3.0-or-later
  * Follows main Spark project policy
* Driver code (drivers/, include/drivers): Apache-2.0
  * Since Zephyr is Apache-2.0, this will make it easier if someone want to put this upstream
* Config files: CC0
  * Don't care, just copy-paste them around
